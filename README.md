this repository is about the calculation of plot-level species area relationship.
we have included multiple variables such as plant richness, root traits, root mass, and climate variables. Within a 40 x 40 m plot, only at the 20 x 20 m scale is plant richness data available. the root traits measurement is based on varied number of cores within the 40 x 40 m plot. when core coordinates are available, the plot-level measurements are based on all these cores distributed within the 40 x 40 m plot.
